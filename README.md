In the ever-evolving hospitality industry, data-driven decisions are the key to maximizing revenue and enhancing guest experiences. Using Power BI, I built a Revenue Analytics Dashboard that empowers hotel revenue teams with actionable insights.
✨ Key Insights:
✔ Revenue Performance: Track Total Revenue, RevPAR, ADR & Occupancy Trends 📈
✔ Booking Trends: Analyze seasonality, direct vs. OTA bookings, and lead times 🏨
✔ Customer Segmentation: Identify high-value guests, repeat customers & geographic trends 🌎
✔ Cancellation & No-Show Impact: Minimize revenue loss with data-backed policies 🚫
✔ Ancillary Revenue Insights: Optimize F&B, spa, and event offerings for profitability 🍽️
📊 What’s Next?
Leveraging forecasting models & dynamic pricing strategies, this dashboard helps revenue teams maximize profits, reduce costs, and enhance guest satisfaction.
